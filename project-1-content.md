# Latin Square Dancing

## High Concept/Genre

*The great oldfashioned latin square game of Sudoku, but with an avoidance twist!*

## Platform

Desktop Only

## Aesthetics

### Graphics

Very simple traditional Sudoku board in the foreground. The background will be distracting and incorporate the avoidance of bright or obnoxious shapes. The plain board and exciting background will contrast each other.

### Sound

Upbeat music. Start with a groovy tune, progress towards something frantic or operatic toward the end. 

### UI

Display how many cells on the board are left to be filled and a timer.

## Gameplay

The player will use the mouse and any numbers on the keyboard to fill the Sudoku board while using the arrow keys to move the board in order to avoid any incoming geometry.

## Mechanics

### How to Win

Avoid the shapes until you can complete the Sudoku board. Lives may be implemented depending on the difficulty but if too many shapes touch the board the player will lose.

## Controls

WASD or Arrow Keys to move, Mouse to move the cursor, LeftMB to select the Sudoku cell under the cursor, and Number keys to type in desired input.

## Player Learning

The player must condition themselves to keep an eye on the background and incoming shapes, coordinating that mechanic to the movement keys, all the while using their eyes to scan the board for possible cell solutions. Sudoku puzzles in themselves have many tactics regarding how to scan and eliminate possible numbers by using the cells you begin with or have solved.

## About the developer

Justin Connolly is a Second Year GDD student who likes to stay hydrated like Jennifer Aniston likes to stay hydrated. He worked as a TA in a summer program at his old school and some days he taught the students Sudoku. Some of them were bored and only cared about Fortnite. Not sure if Sudoku: Battle Royale is a thing yet but maybe this is good enough for the scamps.
